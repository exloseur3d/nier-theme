The Nier theme is an Obsidian theme inspired by the UI of the video game "NieR: Automata".

This theme tries to be as close looking to the game menu while still being usable and easy on the eyes with the warm "mono" color scheme.

# PREFACE
## ABOUT ME
My name is Bryan, I am a French geologist (not yet but about to become one) and I am in no way an expert in coding. Before going into geology, I did some study in 3D animation and VFX, and that's where I learned a bit about coding in the program Houdini. I am making this theme in my free time as I use Obsidian as my main note-taking app. You probably guessed it, I am a huge fan of the universe created by Yoko Taro and I also like simple interfaces, which explains this theme. This theme is for my personal use first, but I decided to share it with the community. I will try my best to troubleshoot this theme if you find any problems or bugs with it.

## LINK
### INTERNAL LINK
They have 2 different colors to indicate if the link points to an existing note or not. While there are 2 colors for internal links, they are close enough to not be distracting but different enough to remind you that you can create a note on a link.

### EXTERNAL LINK
While internal links are brown/red, **external** links are blue with a small logo to make it easy to differentiate them from internal links.
